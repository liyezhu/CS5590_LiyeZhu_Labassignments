In computational linguistics, lemmatisation is the algorithmic process of determining the lemma for a given word.
Since the process may involve complex tasks such as understanding context and  determining the part of speech of a word in a sentence it can be a hard task to implement a lemmatiser for a new language.
Lemmatisation is closely related to stemming.
The difference is that a stemmer operates on a single word without knowledge of the context, and therefore cannot discriminate between words which have different meanings depending on part of speech.
However, stemmers are typically easier to implement Lemmatisation is closely related to stemming.

However, stemmers are typically easier to implement and run faster, and the reduced accuracy may not matter for some applications.
